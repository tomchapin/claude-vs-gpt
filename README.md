# Introduction:

This is repo that compares the performance of the following:
**GPT-4** vs **Claude 3** in following aspects for GUI application development,
This repo is for the purpose of learning and understanding the performance of the both **LLM**.
And these were tested on platform [Fast-Chat](https://chat.lmsys.org/) to compare both two **LLMs** side by side.

# Directory Structure.

The directory strucutre is as follows:
- **claude-apps**: It contains all the applications source that were generated by _Claude-3_ latest model.
- **gpt-apps**: It contains all the applications source that were generated by _GPT-4_ latest model.
- **prompts**: It contains all the data for prompts that were given to generate these applications.

# Conclusion:

In the end, I concluded that for the application development and coding tasks the **Claude-3** is much better than **GPT-4** model and does better job overall And it makes less errors and is more accurate.
But on the other hand **GPT-4** is also par with **Claude-3** in terms of speed and accuracy.
